# Library Membership System (Java)

A console-based Java program I created to manage library memberships.  
The program asks for the user's name and age, validates the input, assigns a membership type with the corresponding price, and checks if the user has enough balance to pay.

## Features
- Name input validation (letters and spaces only)
- Age validation (12–100 years)
- Membership types with different prices:
  - Child Membership (12–17 years)
  - Adult Membership (18–59 years)
  - Senior Membership (60+ years)
- Payment verification
- Personalized messages for the user

## How to Run
1. Compile: `javac LibraryMembershipSystem.java`  
2. Run: `java LibraryMembershipSystem`  


## What I Learned
- Using loops and conditions to validate input  
- Structuring code into multiple methods for clarity  
- Handling user input with Scanner  
- Performing arithmetic and decision-making in Java
